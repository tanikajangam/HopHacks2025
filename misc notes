notes notes notes for building on meta quest 2 vr headset

sooo its finicky
make sure headset is connected, debug mode on, usb debugging (the classics yknow)
file --> build settings --> refresh --> meta quest or whatever

  
THE MAIN ISSUE its architecture (meta quest does NOT support ARMx7 architecture it only does ARM64)
so go to file --> build settings --> player settings --> other settings tab --> configuration --> scripting backend --> change from mono to IL2CPP
hopefully it works !!!!!

i dunno this is just my own documentation of issues i ran into
