notes notes notes for building on meta quest 2 vr headset

sooo its finicky
make sure headset is connected, debug mode on, usb debugging (the classics yknow)
file --> build settings --> refresh --> meta quest or whatever

  
THE MAIN ISSUE its architecture (meta quest does NOT support ARMx7 architecture it only does ARM64)
so go to file --> build settings --> player settings --> other settings tab --> configuration --> scripting backend --> change from mono to IL2CPP
uncheck ARMx7 and check ARM64 
hopefully it works !!!!!

also dont forget to turn off the xr simulator thing so that you can actually move and whatnot

i dunno this is just my own documentation of issues i ran into

DONT FORGET TO TURN OFF XR DEVICE MANAGER OR INTERACTION THING ITS SOMEWHERE IN EDIT --> PROJECT SETTINGS --> XR --> UNCHECK BOX BEFORE BUILDING TO QUEST
